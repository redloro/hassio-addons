# Virtual iTach Flex Serial Adapter

Like the physical iTach Flex serial devices, this supports up to eight simultaenous,
bidirectional TCP-to-serial connections on port 4999.

This is built as a Home Assistant HASS.IO add-on Docker container, however this
can just as easily be used as a standalone server.
